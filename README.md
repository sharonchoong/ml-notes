# Basic Neural Network Template Notebooks
For future reference, saving Jupyter Notebook templates here.  These were originally for a simple neural network project on imbalanced time-series dataset with a binary output. 
Replaced actual dataset with randomly generated data.

Includes:
* Loading pandas DataFrame into Tensorflow Dataset
* Data normalization
* Oversampling
* Class weights in model fit
* Training, validation, testing
* Weight bias initialization
* Accuracy, precision and recall threshold tuning
* Early stopping
* Model checkpoint callbacks
* Single- and multi-step multivariate data for LSTM
* Model output results export

To explore:
* Regularization
* Feature crosses
* Plotting ROC curve
* CNN
* WaveNet
* BERT for NLP
